# OOP Principles with Java

This project is a simple Java application that demonstrates the four fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation.

## Abstraction

In the `abstraction` package, we have defined an abstract interface called `Shape`, which represents shapes. This interface is implemented by different classes, such as `Circle` and `Square`.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is showcased in the `polymorphism` package. We use the `Shape` interface, and you can see how different shapes, like circles and squares, can be treated as the same type using polymorphism.

## Inheritance

The `inheritance` package demonstrates inheritance. The `Shape` class is the base class, and the `Circle` and `Square` classes inherit from it. This allows them to share common attributes and behaviors.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is exemplified in the `encapsulation` package. We define a `Shape` class with private properties (color, x, and y coordinates) and provide methods to access and manipulate these properties.

These examples help you understand how these fundamental OOP principles can be applied in Java.

Feel free to explore the code in the respective packages to see the principles in action.

**Note:** This project is meant for educational purposes to illustrate OOP principles in a simple manner. Real-world applications can be more complex.
